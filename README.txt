= What versions of WordPress does this work with? =
We tested with 4.6.1, 4.4.2, 3.8.1, 3.7.1, and 3.6.1 but it probably works with other versions (3.x or greater).  

Let us know in the "Compatibility" poll if it does work with a particular version, and let us know (via the Support tab) if there are any other issues. Thanks!
